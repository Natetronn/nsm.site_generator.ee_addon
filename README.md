# NSM Site Generator

Many years in the making it's finally starting to take shape.

# Create a new EE install (for testing purposes)
# Download the addon and copy files to `system/expressionengine/third_party/nsm_site_generator`
# Install the module, extension
# Set the theme import / export path in the extension settings (bundles included in repo)
# Open the module
# Export your current site as a new theme or import an existing site
# Profitâ€¦

## Todo:

* Backup existing templates on export
* Implement third party custom field dependency checking
* Implement third party custom field hooks for import / export
* Create bootstrap theme based on Newism's naming conventions
